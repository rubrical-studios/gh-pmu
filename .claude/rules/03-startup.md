## Charter Detection

At startup, check for project charter:

### Step 1: Check for Opt-Out

```bash
test -f .no-charter
```

**If `.no-charter` exists:** Skip all charter prompting, proceed to specialist loading.

### Step 2: Check for CHARTER.md

```bash
test -f CHARTER.md
```

**If CHARTER.md does not exist:** Go to Step 4 (Extraction/Inception prompt).

### Step 3: Template Detection

Check if CHARTER.md contains unfilled template placeholders:

```
Regex: /{[a-z][a-z0-9-]*}/
```

**If placeholders found (template):** Go to Step 4 (Extraction/Inception prompt).
**If no placeholders (complete):** Display charter summary:

```
📋 Project: {project-name} (from CHARTER.md)
   Vision: {vision summary}
   Current focus: {current focus}
```

Then proceed to specialist loading.

### Step 4: Extraction/Inception Prompt

When no charter or template detected, offer to create one:

**If existing code found:**
```
📁 I found code in this project but no charter files.

A charter helps me understand your project's goals.
Would you like me to:

  1. Analyze the code and draft a charter
  2. Skip for now
  3. Never ask for this project
```

**If no code (new project):**
```
📁 This looks like a new project.

A charter helps me understand your goals.
Would you like me to:

  1. Guide you through charter creation
  2. Skip for now
  3. Never ask for this project
```

### User Response Handling

| Choice | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Option 1** | Run `/charter` command (Extraction or Inception mode) |
