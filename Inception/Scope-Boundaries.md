## User Workflows

### Primary Workflow

**Name:** Issue Lifecycle Management

1. User runs `gh pmu list --status backlog`
2. System displays issues with project metadata
3. User runs `gh pmu move 42 --status in_progress`
4. System updates project field, confirms change
5. User completes work, runs `gh pmu move 42 --status done`
6. System moves to Done, auto-closes issue

### Secondary Workflows

| Workflow | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Sub-issue management | Create/track child issues | P0 |
| Microsprint | Time-boxed development batches | P1 |
| Release management | Branch-based deployments | P1 |
| Batch triage | Bulk status updates | P2 |

## Boundaries with External Systems

| System | We Handle | They Handle |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| GitHub Issues | Project field updates, sub-issue linking | Issue storage, notifications |
| GitHub Projects | Field mutations via GraphQL | UI, views, automations |
| gh CLI | Extension commands | Base issue/PR commands |
